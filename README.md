# Spectrum
A social networking app similar to Tinder in that it matches users, who may then begin communication. It is different however in that users are not forced to identify on a binary scale but on four spectrums (biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation) users are then matched based on common identification on these scales.
